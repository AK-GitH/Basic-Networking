    <h2>Network Topology Design Using GNS3</h2>

    <p>
        In this project, we use <strong>GNS3</strong>, a powerful network simulation tool, to build and experiment 
        with two distinct network topologies named <strong>Topology A</strong> and <strong>Topology B</strong>. The 
        goal is to understand how different network designs impact connectivity and fault tolerance.
    </p>

    <h3>What We Are Doing:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Topology A:</strong> This network design includes at least 15 end-user devices (like PCs) and 4 
            routers. The network uses <strong>RIP or static routing</strong> and is divided into at least 5 separate 
            subnets. However, there's a challenge: the design has a <strong>single point of failure</strong> â€” one 
            crucial router. If this router fails, communication between certain parts of the network will break down.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Topology B:</strong> Similar to Topology A with the same number of devices and subnets, but 
            designed with <strong>fault tolerance</strong>. Here, if any one router is disabled, communication between 
            all subnets (except those directly dependent on the disabled router) will still continue. This design 
            demonstrates a more robust and resilient network setup.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Communication Testing:</h3>

    <p>
        Both topologies allow any two hosts to communicate using different network protocols, like 
        <strong>ping, TCP, and UDP</strong>. This lets us experiment with various ways devices can exchange data in a 
        simulated network environment.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project introduces concepts like routing, subnetting, and network resilience, making it a great exercise 
        for learning how real-world networks operate and how to plan for potential failures.
